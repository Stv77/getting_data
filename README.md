I tried to bypass the reCAPTCHA on a service marketplace website by keep sending a fake user agent every time I did the pagination, I also tried to generate and load a cookie every time I open the website so it will tell the website to "remember" stateful information about me when I browsed the website in hope that it would solve the reCAPTCHA problem, but it seemed that it didn't. But still with this method, I could scrape all the information I need until the very last page and did it again without having to worry that I would get blocked.
