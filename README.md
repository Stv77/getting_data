I tried to bypass the reCAPTCHA on a service marketplace website by keep on sending a fake user agent every time I did the pagination, I also tried to generate and loaded a cookie every time I opened the website so it would tell the website to "remember" stateful information about me when I browsed the website in hope that it would solve the reCAPTCHA problem, but it seemed that it didn't. But still with this method, I could scrape all the informations I needed until the very last page and did it again without having to worry that I would get blocked.
